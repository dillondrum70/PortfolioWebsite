					&emsp; "This project was the final project for my Game Architecture class.  I worked on a team with a fellow programmer named Sam.  It uses C++, the SFML graphics library, and a small library of helper functions (such as a Vector2 implementation) created by my professor to create a simple platformer.  This project was developed on the same code base I created for the my Snake Game project.  As stated in the Snake Game description, that code base was developed from scratch starting at the beginning of the course and originally used the Allegro graphics library.  It incorporates sound and simple animations.  The game saves and quits when the player hits the escape button.  There are settings for language, sound, and difficulty which changes arrow trap fire rate and the time limit on each of the three levels.
					<br>
					<br>
					&emsp; I was responsible for the language system, player movement and jumping, (basic) physics implementation, save system, arrow trap hazard, and options menu.  My partner, Sam, was responsible for overhauling the previous level system to include new object IDs for parts of the environment like spikes, arrow traps, exit doors, etc.  He also took care of the difficulty levels, art, collectibles, spikes, and the sound system."

					&emsp; "This was another project that was the culmination of a semester's worth of work.  It was an interesting experience because it was my first time developing what was essentially a basic game engine.  The main focus was also on designing code as it was a game architecture course.  We focused on design patterns like the flyweight pattern and the observer pattern.
					<br>
					<br>
					&emsp;  This was one of the best projects I have worked on with another programmer.  We did a great job of coming together to iron out the details and decide what our goal was and how to accomplish it, but also not stepping on each other's toes.  Even after looking at each other's work, we gave each other good feedback, but neither of us had any catastrophic failures."
