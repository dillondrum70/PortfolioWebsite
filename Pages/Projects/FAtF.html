					&emsp; "Flip Against the Frontier is an action-packed arcade pinball game where you play as a character inside the infamously difficult pinball machine, The Frontier.  You must destroy enemies, build gizmos,
					and survive as long as possible to reach the highest score you can!"
					<br>
					<br>
					&emsp; This project was part of the 2023 Ubisoft Game Lab Competition in Montreal.  We had a max of eight developers with ten weeks of production from the release of the theme, Arcade, and the mandate which required at least one gravity mechanic, 
					one creation mechanic, and one destruction mechanic as well as a leaderboard.  Our team consisted of three programmers, two artists, two designers, and one producer."

					&emsp; "This project is the largest and longest I have ever worked on in the realm of game development.  It was a source of many sleepless nights for many of us.  In the span of 10 weeks, I contributed over 350 hours to the project on top of other classes and projects.  Often, class projects are 1-4 weeks and game jams I've participated in have short time frames as well.
					  It was hard to know how to approach this project because we had to decide what to do first and how to scope for almost triple the amount of time we normally had.  Additionally, we had to fit all of this 
					  within the constraints of the theme and mandate of the Ubisoft Game Lab Competition.  With a theme of arcade and seemingly contradictory mandate of creation and destruction mechanics, the concepting phase 
					  was very difficult.
					<br>
					<br>
					&emsp; We originally had two concepts.  One was a 2.5D beat-em-up game and in the other, you played as a janitor in a pinball machine cleaning up messes and destroying old bumpers and parts of the machine with new ones.  We actually had a split vote in our team because neither concept was well thought out at the time.  Our product owner made the final decision to go with the pinball game.  While some on the team were not very happy with the decision, we all remained professional and worked with the concept we chose.  We went through a lot of iteration because the original concept was fairly weak.  With the help of our mentors from Ubisoft, we managed to develop enemies for second-to-second gameplay whereas the pinball is seen less often.  
					<br>
					<br>
					&emsp; We contextualized the gameplay as Flip, who is part of a family of tech geniuses, shrinking herself into the pinball machine to help her big brother get the high score on the infamously difficult pinball game, The Frontier.  The enemies, known as drain dwellers, are the machine's anti-cheat system coming after Flip for cheating.  We also added a magnet-like ability where the player could draw in the ball by holding down right trigger to charge their swing.  Even the tilting of the machine received an overhaul halfway through the project.  Instead of simply tilting, it is now more like the machine is slammed to one side or the other and enemies are thrown into the wall and destroyed.  This allows it to be used as a board-clearing tool to help players in a pinch.
					<br>
					<br>
					&emsp; If I were to do anything differently, I would have increased my communication with designers earlier in the project.  While I struggled to do so early in the project to follow documentation, I quickly learned to closely follow it to see how a mechanic is supposed to work.  However, often I would create a mechanic to match those specifications and later be told that the documentation is out of date.  A lot of development time could have been saved if I had directly asked designers about the features I was working on.  By the end of the project, our communication was much stronger and we worked as a cohesive unit.  Something I think we could have improved on as a team was our concepting speed.  In a ten-week project, it is important to iron out the concept early, but we had a disorganized process and lost the first week of concepting.  In the second week, we brainstormed and allowed the designers to create concepts from our ideas.  Unfortunately, these too were unpolished and we spent a lot of devleopment time finding the fun in our game.  Often it seems the concepting phase is discounted, but we have learned that it is one of the most critical junctures in a games development and will not underestimate it in the future.
